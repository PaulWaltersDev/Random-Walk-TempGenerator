# Random-Walk-TempGenerator
A proof of concept for generating fake daily maximum temperature data using a Random Walk Monte Carlo simulation.

Execute the Python file TempGenerator.py and in your /temp folder (or C:\temp) you will see 12 daily max temp graphs, each with a simulated maximum temperature
for each day of the month (based on Sydney CBD, Australia monthly max temperature data points). You will also see a collated CSV file with all
simulated data points by month for the whole year.
